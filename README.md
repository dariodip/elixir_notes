# Elixir Notes

This repository contains notes that I wrote while learning [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

I've decided to use [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/) to organize and run my notes because I think that it is such a power tool and gave me the opportunity to write and run Elixir code in the browser.

Besides writing and running notes, using Livebook I can also include graphics, formulas and snippets of markdown.

## Getting started

I decided to run Livebook inside a Docker container. So, in order to run it, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine.

To run it, you can run the the script [`start`](./start).
